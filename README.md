a simple php script to generate many of your current OSX settings into an executable .sh file so you can configurate a new mac in just a few seconds <3.

**WARNING!!**: the script is NOT ready for production yet


**use** `php run.php` to generate your settings

**use** `sh userSettings.sh` to set your settings


(I think it's best if you know that I started writing this script when I was in a train. There wasn't so much time to structure my code. Feel free to improve it <3)
